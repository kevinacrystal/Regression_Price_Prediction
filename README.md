# Project 2: Ames Housing

## Problem Statement

This project aims to build a price-prediction template based on data collected by the Ames, Iowa Assessorâ€™s Office on individual residential properties sold in Ames, IA from 2006 to 2008.

## Executive Summary
### Methodology:
The project will refine a regression model, fit based on the Ames dataset, with the goal of minimizing root mean squared error, based on a holdout set.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

Several regression models were tested, including Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, and ElasticNet.
The best performing model was Ridge, which acheived a root mean squared error of $23,374. This model also acheived good R-squared scores (0.925 on the training set, 0.913 on the testing set) which suggest minimal overfitting.
