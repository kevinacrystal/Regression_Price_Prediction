# Project 2: Ames Housing

## Problem Statement

This project aims to build a price-prediction template based on data collected by the Ames, Iowa Assessorâ€™s Office on individual residential properties sold in Ames, IA from 2006 to 2008.

## Executive Summary
### Methodology:
The project will refine a regression model, fit based on the Ames dataset, with the goal of minimizing root mean squared error, based on a holdout set (train-test-split).
